Conversational AI platform

We do the heavy lifting — evaluating, fine-tuning, and incorporating LLMs into your business on your behalf. Only with Moveworks will you be able to capture the unique strengths of leading language models trained on a vast repository of enterprise data.
Resource Ingestion
Accessing information from disparate systems can be time-consuming and inefficient. The Moveworks platform brings all your resources to life, eliminating the hassle of sifting through countless documents, portals, files, and workflows. Our platform automatically ingests, standardizes, scans, and annotates every piece of information as it is created converting them into up-to-date, action-oriented snippets. 
Workflow Orchestration
The Moveworks platform makes it easy to tackle complex tasks involving multiple backend systems, like provisioning software and managing approvals. Built with a deep understanding of enterprise support, our platform streamlines processes leveraging both our out-of-the-box solutions and deep integrations. Let Moveworks' AI handle the complexity, so you can focus on what matters most.
Connectors

Our solution simplifies all your tasks, lookups, and searches, streamlining processes throughout your organization.
Identity & Permissions
Effortlessly manage user access and permissions across your organization. The Moveworks platform is designed to pull relevant user and identity information from backend systems so you don’t have to. By tying these details to a comprehensive, up-to-date identity map, you stay in control, ensuring your team members receive only authorized resources.
Conversational Analytics
Get unprecedented visibility over the health of their entire support experience. Moveworks’ natural language understanding analyzes unstructured data across your enterprise environment to present a simple, actionable to-do list, so leaders can identify critical issues, prioritize projects, invest in the right technologies, and more.

Multi-LLM Strategy
Different large language models perform better at different tasks. You get access to the highest performing models, including: OpenAI’s GPT-4 for search relevance, Google’s BERT for intent classification, and Meta’s RoBERTa for entity recognition.
Enterprise Data
Most off-the-shelf LLMs are trained on public data, not your company’s data. Moveworks incorporates secure training data from 500M+ support tickets, 10B+ bot conversations, and 100M+ enterprise resources to ensure the language models understand the language of work.
Entity Grounding
To maximize factuality and minimize hallucinations from LLMs, you need to automatically send prompts to the LLM  with content of your business. Moveworks automatically mines company specific entities (identity maps, distribution lists, conference room names, software catalog, etc.) and provides that information in every prompt.
Broadcom is resolving 57%+ of IT issues while seeing a 40% reduction in incidents with Moveworks

Model evaluation
New models come out every day and perform better at specific tasks than old models. Moveworks is deeply ingrained in the latest research and has access to models before they’re publicly released, meaning we are able to automatically swap them out to maximize performance and accuracy.
Model fine-tuning
LLMs can’t be fine-tuned with your company data because most of them are too large to host on infrastructure. To perform better than LLMs at specific tasks in the enterprise, Moveworks fine-tunes smaller models with the language of work. This also results in lower latency for the end-user experience.
Model annotation
To get the most out of model performance, you need a team to constantly evaluate its performance. At Moveworks, we have a robust annotation operation where trained linguists securely review bot conversations and provide real-time feedback to the models.
Model infrastructure
Calling large language model APIs for every natural language task can be costly and provide a poor latency experience. Moveworks has built proprietary model infrastructure to host smaller models that are fine-tuned, allowing for better performance and minimal latency.
Conversation experience
Users speak naturally, and Moveworks understands. Whether it’s in any language, or the user wants to switch topics, or the user doesn’t know what they’re looking for, Moveworks handles the conversation in a delightful way.
Search and action reasoning
Businesses have a sea of resources to answer questions: knowledge articles, forms, structured information in backend systems, workflows, and more. Moveworks leverages LLMs to decide the best answer or combination of answers to provide.

Unlike every other reporting tool you’ve seen, Employee Experience Insights works by investigating the unstructured language in your support tickets, then visualizes the most important problems slowing down your workforce. Finally, you’ll see the experiences behind the services you deliver.
EXI lets you dig deeper than ever before into how your investments in applications, systems, and support teams are performing, relative to benchmarks from your peers. That means you can change a confusing process, migrate to a different tool, or launch a new initiative — with total confidence.
Now, you can identify the key challenges facing each individual department, from marketing to engineering to sales. EXI puts you in control of your employee experience: you can share insights and prove impact with a single click.
There are endless features for your team to explore in Employee Experience Insights. Here are three of our favorites:
Our Employee Issues Map condenses thousands of unique issues into a powerful bird’s-eye view, where you can instantly spot opportunities to accelerate a process or prevent a problem in advance. And once you’ve locked in on a particular category, EXI enables you to find the root cause — with a granular breakdown of every type of issue in that category.
EXI allows you to track the critical indicators of your employee experience — such as average issues per employee, time to resolution, and first-contact resolution rate — against real-world benchmarks. By spending just a few minutes of your week in EXI, you’ll develop a data-driven, expert perspective on how to create a workplace that’s truly world-class.
The ability to filter EXI by departments, groups, and timeframes is a game-changer. You can now determine which issues are slowing down your sales team, your new hires, or your remote employees, at any moment in time. These personas are created by ingesting identity tables from across your systems of record, enabling you to define custom cohorts.
My job is to empower our digital workforce with the tools and technologies they need to perform at their best. With Moveworks' sophisticated NLU and Employee Experience Insights, we have meaningful and actionable data to turn thousands of requests into an efficient plan of action — and a best-in-class employee experience.

Every employee deserves instant support, no matter what language they speak. With Moveworks, employees get support in seconds — simply by asking for help in their native tongue. 
Most help desks struggle to support a global workforce: they process thousands of urgent requests from employees, at all hours of the day. But Moveworks resolves these requests in more than 100 languages, completely automatically, so your help desk can deliver high-speed support from Tokyo to Paris to Berlin.
Moveworks provides truly multilingual support to employees in their native language.
No training required: employees can get help just by asking. And when they switch languages, Moveworks adapts on a dime.
Moveworks is a one-stop shop for every employee to submit every issue — in every language. 
Our platform goes well beyond translation to interpret enterprise jargon, including conference room names, email groups, and company policies. It’s engineered to understand the way employees request help at work.
Moveworks provides the right solution to employees’ requests, such as snippets from knowledge articles in the appropriate language.
Our platform ingests thousands of support resources, the moment they’re published, so employees don’t need to go digging for what they need.
Moveworks has pioneered the first AI platform that engages employees in their native language, deeply understands their requests, and provides the right resources in real time.
Under the hood, we had to evolve the entire Moveworks Intelligence Engine™ to become multilingual:
Moveworks is designed to engage employees on their terms, without following a script. Now, our platform can switch languages and determine the ideal response on the fly — using machine learning models trained on more than 250 million support requests. 
Especially with a multilingual workforce, your support platform needs to hold dynamic conversations to resolve every unique issue. That’s why our conversation engine continuously learns from each interaction, allowing Moveworks to provide a simple, unscripted experience to employees around the world.
Moveworks uses advanced natural language understanding (NLU) to determine exactly what employees need. By building upon our deep knowledge of enterprise terminology, our platform can interpret requests however they’re phrased.
This level of NLU requires layers of machine learning models. Our approach allows Moveworks to detect languages with 98% accuracy, make sense of ambiguous entities, correct for grammar and spelling, and identify terms unique to each company.
Moveworks solves support issues end-to-end by scouring your company for the most useful solution — in the appropriate language. Our platform automatically ingests support resources the moment they’re live, then ranks them with probabilistic machine learning, based on their relevance for the employee. 
Support teams create knowledge articles that contain an incredible level of detail. To make that information accessible to employees, we evolved our semantic search system to find the relevant snippet of information across multiple languages.

Moveworks routes complicated support requests to the right expert or group — with 96% accuracy.
Using a bespoke machine learning model created for every single customer, our platform learns to distinguish between thousands of assignment groups. Now, issues start getting solved the moment they’re submitted.
On average, L1 service desks take 5 hours to read and then route employees’ support issues. But Moveworks automatically sends each issue to the correct assignment group within 30 seconds.
Our platform makes your queue disappear. Employees spend less time waiting for help — and more time on what matters.
Service desk agents have to remember hundreds or even thousands of assignment groups, which means that misrouted tickets are inevitable.
This is a problem made for machine learning. Our custom classification models are 96% accurate at routine tickets, and they never stop improving.
Every issue that Moveworks routes is work saved for the service desk. For large companies, that frees up millions of dollars to reallocate toward high impact projects.

By using advanced natural language understanding, Concierge can converse directly with employees, eliminating the need for help desk agents to intervene. This can reduce the time it takes to resolve issues, improving productivity and reducing frustration.
Concierge provides both employees and service desks with unprecedented visibility into support issues. Employees can see the status of their requests in real time, and service desks can track progress and prioritize the most important requests.
By intelligently managing thousands of interactions, Concierge ensures that nothing gets lost in the shuffle. This can improve the efficiency of employee support and help reduce the workload on support teams.
Concierge allows for significant interactivity, providing an automated middle-man between your users and agents.
Users will automatically receive a ticket notification if an agent adds a comment, there is a significant status change, or a specific amount of time has passed with no change to the ticket.
If an issue is not resolved automatically, users have the ability to file a ticket in-chat, creating a ticket at the back-end of your ITSM system for your agents.
Users may check on the status of all their tickets anytime or a specific ticket, simply by asking in-chat.
Users may add comments in response to agent questions, directly in-chat.
When a user wishes to close a ticket, they may do so. As a result of this, Moveworks marks the ticket as resolved.
When a user wishes to reopen a ticket, they may also do so. As a result of this, Moveworks will update the status of the ticket back to new.
Based on the nature of the user’s issue, Moveworks will predict what type of ticket needs to be created. Users can also correct the domain manually if necessary.
One of the things that I use AppDynoBot for, quite frequently, is just inquiring on the status of my open tickets, and that’s something any employee can do, instantly.

Employee Communications lets you personalize each message using parameters like employee location, department, employment status, and more. This empowers you to send information uniquely relevant to each employee, increasing engagement.
Moveworks’ AI knows and understands every one of your knowledge base articles, FAQs, and troubleshooting docs. So, when employees follow up on internal communication messages with questions, Moveworks serves up the correct answers on your behalf — automatically.
Moveworks ensures that employees know exactly what to do next and can easily take action. Registering for events, reading the latest remote work policy, or completing employee surveys can be all done directly within your enterprise messaging app.
There are endless features for your team to explore in Employee Communications. Here are some of our favorites:
Campaigns can be targeted by department, location, and other user metadata. Employee Communications even gives real-time feedback about your selected audience before you hit send.
Employees can allow all notifications, mute for seven days, or opt out of all general notifications. Admins always have the ability to override user preferences for critical communications. 
Moveworks can dynamically understand any language on-the-fly, ingest non-English articles and serve up the right snippet in responses, and back-translate tickets to English for system compliance.
Send messages immediately or schedule them for a later day or time. This ensures that messages reach employees at just the right moment, even if your employees are globally distributed.
Based on your objective, Moveworks suggests scheduling reminders to further improve employee engagement. These messages are only sent to non-engaged users, and you can edit, schedule, or cancel reminders after publishing any campaign.
Keep track of delivery metrics, CTA, and engagement data in one place. Track trends over time to optimize campaigns and replicate successes.
Moveworks is a much more personable way of communicating than emails. It’s like a real-time conversation: the bot answers follow-up questions and points people in the right direction.

The best UI is through your own natural language. It doesn’t matter how your users phrase their questions – whether it’s generic like “edit a list” or hyper-specific like “Please remove Marc Thompson from the sales@acme.ai email distribution list” – Moveworks can understand their underlying intent.                                                                                   
Whether it’s creating a new list, adding themselves or others, or removing themselves or others, Moveworks incorporates your existing group access configuration and allows you to modify them.        
Moveworks is integrated with your source of truth email systems and provides access to users by automatically updating the group. To keep a clear audit trail, Moveworks logs every interaction in your ITSM.
Groups Access comes packed with features, acting as the conversational layer between users and distribution list management.
If the user doesn’t specify which group, Moveworks provides options through chat-modal forms and lets the user decide.
The user can respond in natural language, without needing to click any buttons or copy the exact text of the DL, and Moveworks still understands.          
Configure logic related to an employee’s role (e.g. “is manager”), an existing group member, and group owner, automatic provisioning without approvals, and more for each list.
Based on your configured approvals workflows, the correct approver will automatically get notifications with the right level of detail to approve or deny the request in chat.
Users who get removed from a distribution list from someone else automatically receive notifications in chat.
From accessing software to resetting MFA credentials, 1.Bot means we don't have to have service desk agents working on these requests. Moveworks allows my team to pursue new opportunities and projects that wouldn't have been possible before. And for employees, the time savings are tremendous.

The best UI is through your own natural language.

Whether you’d like to auto-provision software, have IT complete the next final step, incorporate manager approvals, provide a knowledge article, let a user fill out a form, or require them to file a ticket – Moveworks ingests your default workflows and lets you configure them.
Moveworks is integrated with your source of truth identity & access management system and provides access to users by automatically updating the security group tied to the software.

All day long, your team is fielding approval requests and policy questions, preventing them from focusing on meaningful work. Moveworks autonomously responds to routine issues, from vendor payment approvals to expense report submissions. That way, your finance team can focus on what matters most — the financial success of your company.

No one likes to wait weeks, sometimes months, for their expense report to be approved and paid out. Employees feel frustrated with long wait times and finance teams are overrun with follow-up questions. Moveworks instantly resolves and routes employees’ requests, giving them the best — and fastest — support experience possible.

The financial future of your company depends on every employee playing their part. That means your employees need to know your organization's financial policies and how to take action next.

Help HR empower your global workforce with AI that automatically solves hundreds of HR issues from day one — without any added work from your team.
Give employees exactly what they need the moment they ask for it. Advanced machine learning delivers conversational support, tailored to employees’ locations, roles, and more.
Put your forms, knowledge articles, and FAQ pages to work. Moveworks’ AI surfaces the best possible resources by deeply integrating with HR systems, including Jira and Workday.

HR support requires deep understanding and personalization. That’s why Moveworks for HR is built with layers of machine learning models. Our AI analyzes every request, and weighs every possible response in real time, from location and language preference to security permissions and role, to surface the best possible response for every request.
HR issues are rarely as simple as a question and an answer. While Moveworks autonomously resolves 65% of HR issues, some situations will always require a help desk agent to step in and assist. Moveworks’ AI understands HR, meaning it knows exactly what your employees need when they ask for help — however they ask for it. When an issue needs to be routed to a specialist, Moveworks seamlessly hands them off to the right person.
Employees aren’t thinking about complex support org structure when they have a question. They just want their questions answered and don’t want to search through multiple HR information systems their company might have. Moveworks for HR offers a single place for employees to get help across various departments and systems.
We support over 1,000 team members across the globe with different needs and circumstances. Moveworks navigates this complexity for us, which means our people get the personal touch they expect from HR, but without having to wait. To create an incredible employee experience, you need the combination of HR and AI

Moveworks automates away the most common support issues, including resetting passwords, unlocking accounts, editing email groups, filing forms, troubleshooting devices, and much, much more. It’s the only way to eliminate the cost of these L1 issues, once and for all.
Reducing your help desk support costs often creates a frustrating employee experience, whether you implement an automated phone system or outsource to an MSP. But Moveworks delivers white-glove support, since employees describe issues to our conversational AI bot just as they would to an agent.


Help desks often invest in self-service resources, such as troubleshooting guides and hardware request forms, only to watch employees submit the same volume of tickets as before. Moveworks digs through every single resource at your company to find the best solution to each issue — so you can finally see some ROI.

In theory, employees could solve a huge percentage of their support issues without involving the help desk — if only they knew where to look. Moveworks makes that theory a reality. Our platform serves up the most helpful solution to common requests from across your ITSM, IAM system, knowledge bases, and other tools.
 
When employees submit complex issues that require an expert to fix, Moveworks still speeds up the entire ticket lifecycle. Our AI chatbot handles the back-and-forth communication with employees to add comments, nudge agents, and check status, so your help desk doesn’t have to.
Large companies waste millions of dollars per year on unused software licenses — while employees who really do need a software license often wait days to get access. Moveworks lets you take back control. Our platform provisions software in seconds, obtains approval when necessary, and reclaims licenses that employees don’t need.

Moveworks provides true multilingual support to employees in their native tongue — no training required. Employees can get help instantly, just by asking. Because Moveworks doesn’t follow a script, when employees switch languages, our platform adapts on a dime.
Moveworks is a one-stop shop for any employee to submit any issue, in any language. Our platform goes well beyond translation to interpret enterprise jargon, including conference room names, email groups, and company policies. It’s engineered to understand the way employees request help at work.
Moveworks provides the right solution to employees’ requests, such as snippets from knowledge articles in the appropriate language.
Our platform ingests thousands of support resources, the moment they’re published, so employees don’t need to go digging for what they need.
Languages fully supported by the Moveworks platform

Moveworks is designed to engage employees on their terms, without following a script. Our platform can switch languages and determine the ideal response on the fly — using machine learning models trained on more than 250 million support requests.
Especially with a multilingual workforce, your support platform needs to hold dynamic conversations to resolve every unique issue. That’s why our conversation engine continuously learns from each interaction, allowing Moveworks to provide a simple, unscripted experience to employees around the world.
Moveworks uses advanced natural language understanding (NLU) to determine exactly what employees need. By building upon our deep knowledge of enterprise terminology, our platform can interpret requests however they’re phrased.
Employees can file tickets in any language of their choice. Our platform automatically translates their ticket so any agent can quickly understand the issue. Once the issue is resolved, Moveworks translates the entire ticket back to English to ensure system compliance.
Support teams create knowledge articles that contain an incredible level of detail. To make that information accessible to employees, we evolved our semantic search system to find the relevant snippet of information across multiple languages.
After your employees have been helped, you can find out exactly what issues are slowing your team down with our advanced insights tools.

"As a global company, we need to provide the same quality of support to every employee at Albemarle to empower their potential, no matter which languages they speak. Moveworks gives our people 24/7 help in their native language — just by having a natural conversation with the bot.

Multi-LLM Strategy
Different large language models perform better at different tasks. You get access to the highest performing models, including: OpenAI’s GPT-4 for search relevance, Google’s BERT for intent classification, and Meta’s RoBERTa for entity recognition.
Enterprise Data
Most off-the-shelf LLMs are trained on public data, not your company’s data. Moveworks incorporates secure training data from 500M+ support tickets, 10B+ bot conversations, and 100M+ enterprise resources to ensure the language models understand the language of work.
Entity Grounding
To maximize factuality and minimize hallucinations from LLMs, you need to automatically send prompts to the LLM  with content of your business. Moveworks automatically mines company specific entities (identity maps, distribution lists, conference room names, software catalog, etc.) and provides that information in every prompt.
Broadcom is resolving 57%+ of IT issues while seeing a 40% reduction in incidents with Moveworks

Model evaluation
New models come out every day and perform better at specific tasks than old models. Moveworks is deeply ingrained in the latest research and has access to models before they’re publicly released, meaning we are able to automatically swap them out to maximize performance and accuracy.
Model fine-tuning
LLMs can’t be fine-tuned with your company data because most of them are too large to host on infrastructure. To perform better than LLMs at specific tasks in the enterprise, Moveworks fine-tunes smaller models with the language of work. This also results in lower latency for the end-user experience.
Model annotation
To get the most out of model performance, you need a team to constantly evaluate its performance. At Moveworks, we have a robust annotation operation where trained linguists securely review bot conversations and provide real-time feedback to the models.
Model infrastructure
Calling large language model APIs for every natural language task can be costly and provide a poor latency experience. Moveworks has built proprietary model infrastructure to host smaller models that are fine-tuned, allowing for better performance and minimal latency.
Conversation experience
Users speak naturally, and Moveworks understands. Whether it’s in any language, or the user wants to switch topics, or the user doesn’t know what they’re looking for, Moveworks handles the conversation in a delightful way.
Search and action reasoning
Businesses have a sea of resources to answer questions: knowledge articles, forms, structured information in backend systems, workflows, and more. Moveworks leverages LLMs to decide the best answer or combination of answers to provide.

Unlike every other reporting tool you’ve seen, Employee Experience Insights works by investigating the unstructured language in your support tickets, then visualizes the most important problems slowing down your workforce. Finally, you’ll see the experiences behind the services you deliver.
EXI lets you dig deeper than ever before into how your investments in applications, systems, and support teams are performing, relative to benchmarks from your peers. That means you can change a confusing process, migrate to a different tool, or launch a new initiative — with total confidence.
Now, you can identify the key challenges facing each individual department, from marketing to engineering to sales. EXI puts you in control of your employee experience: you can share insights and prove impact with a single click.
There are endless features for your team to explore in Employee Experience Insights. Here are three of our favorites:
Our Employee Issues Map condenses thousands of unique issues into a powerful bird’s-eye view, where you can instantly spot opportunities to accelerate a process or prevent a problem in advance. And once you’ve locked in on a particular category, EXI enables you to find the root cause — with a granular breakdown of every type of issue in that category.
EXI allows you to track the critical indicators of your employee experience — such as average issues per employee, time to resolution, and first-contact resolution rate — against real-world benchmarks. By spending just a few minutes of your week in EXI, you’ll develop a data-driven, expert perspective on how to create a workplace that’s truly world-class.
The ability to filter EXI by departments, groups, and timeframes is a game-changer. You can now determine which issues are slowing down your sales team, your new hires, or your remote employees, at any moment in time. These personas are created by ingesting identity tables from across your systems of record, enabling you to define custom cohorts.
My job is to empower our digital workforce with the tools and technologies they need to perform at their best. With Moveworks' sophisticated NLU and Employee Experience Insights, we have meaningful and actionable data to turn thousands of requests into an efficient plan of action — and a best-in-class employee experience.

Every employee deserves instant support, no matter what language they speak. With Moveworks, employees get support in seconds — simply by asking for help in their native tongue. 
Most help desks struggle to support a global workforce: they process thousands of urgent requests from employees, at all hours of the day. But Moveworks resolves these requests in more than 100 languages, completely automatically, so your help desk can deliver high-speed support from Tokyo to Paris to Berlin.
Moveworks provides truly multilingual support to employees in their native language.
No training required: employees can get help just by asking. And when they switch languages, Moveworks adapts on a dime.
Moveworks is a one-stop shop for every employee to submit every issue — in every language. 
Our platform goes well beyond translation to interpret enterprise jargon, including conference room names, email groups, and company policies. It’s engineered to understand the way employees request help at work.
Moveworks provides the right solution to employees’ requests, such as snippets from knowledge articles in the appropriate language.
Our platform ingests thousands of support resources, the moment they’re published, so employees don’t need to go digging for what they need.
Moveworks has pioneered the first AI platform that engages employees in their native language, deeply understands their requests, and provides the right resources in real time.
Under the hood, we had to evolve the entire Moveworks Intelligence Engine™ to become multilingual:
Moveworks is designed to engage employees on their terms, without following a script. Now, our platform can switch languages and determine the ideal response on the fly — using machine learning models trained on more than 250 million support requests. 
Especially with a multilingual workforce, your support platform needs to hold dynamic conversations to resolve every unique issue. That’s why our conversation engine continuously learns from each interaction, allowing Moveworks to provide a simple, unscripted experience to employees around the world.
Moveworks uses advanced natural language understanding (NLU) to determine exactly what employees need. By building upon our deep knowledge of enterprise terminology, our platform can interpret requests however they’re phrased.
This level of NLU requires layers of machine learning models. Our approach allows Moveworks to detect languages with 98% accuracy, make sense of ambiguous entities, correct for grammar and spelling, and identify terms unique to each company.
Moveworks solves support issues end-to-end by scouring your company for the most useful solution — in the appropriate language. Our platform automatically ingests support resources the moment they’re live, then ranks them with probabilistic machine learning, based on their relevance for the employee. 
Support teams create knowledge articles that contain an incredible level of detail. To make that information accessible to employees, we evolved our semantic search system to find the relevant snippet of information across multiple languages.

Moveworks routes complicated support requests to the right expert or group — with 96% accuracy.
Using a bespoke machine learning model created for every single customer, our platform learns to distinguish between thousands of assignment groups. Now, issues start getting solved the moment they’re submitted.
On average, L1 service desks take 5 hours to read and then route employees’ support issues. But Moveworks automatically sends each issue to the correct assignment group within 30 seconds.
Our platform makes your queue disappear. Employees spend less time waiting for help — and more time on what matters.
Service desk agents have to remember hundreds or even thousands of assignment groups, which means that misrouted tickets are inevitable.
This is a problem made for machine learning. Our custom classification models are 96% accurate at routine tickets, and they never stop improving.
Every issue that Moveworks routes is work saved for the service desk. For large companies, that frees up millions of dollars to reallocate toward high impact projects.

Centralize hundreds of your documents within Moveworks, so users can search any snippet of information buried across different applications and systems in one place – maximizing their productivity.                                                  
Moveworks Enterprise Cache™ is constantly ingesting documents across your systems and hundreds of public knowledge sources in real-time. By analyzing knowledge gaps with ML, you’ll receive recommendations on what to create & update.                    
By ingesting platform permissions from ACL tables, Moveworks will always provide information that users are permitted to view, along with personalized responses based on user and conversational context.
Users can look up information that personalized, public, and permissioned. Below are some of the most popular ways customers have leveraged Queries today
Answers comes packed with features, acting as the conversational layer between users and enterprise documents.
Shows a single high-precision answer whenever a specific question is asked, providing a decluttered experience.

Translates snippets shown to end-users on-the-fly to provide a more personalized experience without your team having to translate documents to every employee’s language.

Don’t let slow and frustrating approvals processes dent your ESAT score – with one click, your employees can approve or deny in seconds, all within their preferred collaboration software.
Need to approve IT spend, work-from-home benefits, or PTO? Provide a unified approval queue in-chat, no matter which system it comes from.
With Moveworks approvals, easy doesn’t mean risky. Our enterprise-grade, air-tight security protocols will protect every message, interaction, and approval. 
Moveworks can speed up approvals across a number of platforms – with more coming every month.
Moveworks Approvals comes packed with features, acting as the conversational layer between managers, users and their approvals.
Based on your configured approvals workflows, the correct approver will automatically get notifications with the right level of detail to approve or deny the request in chat.
Allow users to take action on approvals directly in-chat, or if necessary, use a deep link to access the relevant approval in your system of record.
Managers can retrieve a list of all their open approvals any time they ask their Moveworks chatbot.
Drive a chain reaction of acceleration by reminding approvers of all their open approvals anytime they accept or decline one.
If someone needs an app through Okta, Moveworks gets approvals and provisions the Okta tile. We don't have to touch it.

By using advanced natural language understanding, Concierge can converse directly with employees, eliminating the need for help desk agents to intervene. This can reduce the time it takes to resolve issues, improving productivity and reducing frustration.
Concierge provides both employees and service desks with unprecedented visibility into support issues. Employees can see the status of their requests in real time, and service desks can track progress and prioritize the most important requests.
By intelligently managing thousands of interactions, Concierge ensures that nothing gets lost in the shuffle. This can improve the efficiency of employee support and help reduce the workload on support teams.
Concierge allows for significant interactivity, providing an automated middle-man between your users and agents.
Users will automatically receive a ticket notification if an agent adds a comment, there is a significant status change, or a specific amount of time has passed with no change to the ticket.
If an issue is not resolved automatically, users have the ability to file a ticket in-chat, creating a ticket at the back-end of your ITSM system for your agents.
Users may check on the status of all their tickets anytime or a specific ticket, simply by asking in-chat.
Users may add comments in response to agent questions, directly in-chat.
When a user wishes to close a ticket, they may do so. As a result of this, Moveworks marks the ticket as resolved.
When a user wishes to reopen a ticket, they may also do so. As a result of this, Moveworks will update the status of the ticket back to new.
Based on the nature of the user’s issue, Moveworks will predict what type of ticket needs to be created. Users can also correct the domain manually if necessary.
One of the things that I use AppDynoBot for, quite frequently, is just inquiring on the status of my open tickets, and that’s something any employee can do, instantly.

Employee Communications lets you personalize each message using parameters like employee location, department, employment status, and more. This empowers you to send information uniquely relevant to each employee, increasing engagement.
Moveworks’ AI knows and understands every one of your knowledge base articles, FAQs, and troubleshooting docs. So, when employees follow up on internal communication messages with questions, Moveworks serves up the correct answers on your behalf — automatically.
Moveworks ensures that employees know exactly what to do next and can easily take action. Registering for events, reading the latest remote work policy, or completing employee surveys can be all done directly within your enterprise messaging app.
There are endless features for your team to explore in Employee Communications. Here are some of our favorites:
Campaigns can be targeted by department, location, and other user metadata. Employee Communications even gives real-time feedback about your selected audience before you hit send.
Employees can allow all notifications, mute for seven days, or opt out of all general notifications. Admins always have the ability to override user preferences for critical communications. 
Moveworks can dynamically understand any language on-the-fly, ingest non-English articles and serve up the right snippet in responses, and back-translate tickets to English for system compliance.
Send messages immediately or schedule them for a later day or time. This ensures that messages reach employees at just the right moment, even if your employees are globally distributed.
Based on your objective, Moveworks suggests scheduling reminders to further improve employee engagement. These messages are only sent to non-engaged users, and you can edit, schedule, or cancel reminders after publishing any campaign.
Keep track of delivery metrics, CTA, and engagement data in one place. Track trends over time to optimize campaigns and replicate successes.
Moveworks is a much more personable way of communicating than emails. It’s like a real-time conversation: the bot answers follow-up questions and points people in the right direction.

The best UI is through your own natural language. It doesn’t matter how your users phrase their questions – whether it’s generic like “edit a list” or hyper-specific like “Please remove Marc Thompson from the sales@acme.ai email distribution list” – Moveworks can understand their underlying intent.                                                                                   
Whether it’s creating a new list, adding themselves or others, or removing themselves or others, Moveworks incorporates your existing group access configuration and allows you to modify them.        
Moveworks is integrated with your source of truth email systems and provides access to users by automatically updating the group. To keep a clear audit trail, Moveworks logs every interaction in your ITSM.
Groups Access comes packed with features, acting as the conversational layer between users and distribution list management.
If the user doesn’t specify which group, Moveworks provides options through chat-modal forms and lets the user decide.
The user can respond in natural language, without needing to click any buttons or copy the exact text of the DL, and Moveworks still understands.          
Configure logic related to an employee’s role (e.g. “is manager”), an existing group member, and group owner, automatic provisioning without approvals, and more for each list.
Based on your configured approvals workflows, the correct approver will automatically get notifications with the right level of detail to approve or deny the request in chat.
Users who get removed from a distribution list from someone else automatically receive notifications in chat.
From accessing software to resetting MFA credentials, 1.Bot means we don't have to have service desk agents working on these requests. Moveworks allows my team to pursue new opportunities and projects that wouldn't have been possible before. And for employees, the time savings are tremendous.

The best UI is through your own natural language. It doesn’t matter how your users phrase their questions – whether it’s generic like “ppt please” or hyper-specific like “Please provide me, Madison Smith, access to the software Microsoft Powerpoint” – Moveworks can understand their underlying intent.
Whether you’d like to auto-provision software, have IT complete the next final step, incorporate manager approvals, provide a knowledge article, let a user fill out a form, or require them to file a ticket – Moveworks ingests your default workflows and lets you configure them.
Moveworks is integrated with your source of truth identity & access management system and provides access to users by automatically updating the security group tied to the software. To keep a clean audit trail, Moveworks logs every interaction in your ITSM.                                                                                                                                                        
Moveworks can provision any application that's supported by your Identity and Access Management System. Below are some of the most popular applications provisioned across our customer base.
 
 
 
Software Access comes packed with features, acting as the conversational layer between users and software access management.
Moveworks uses context from your business to provide different suggestions to users if they ask for software you don’t have.    
Help users choose the right applications when multiple kinds of license types are available            
The user can respond in natural language, without needing to click any buttons or copy the exact text of the DL, and Moveworks still understands.          
Configure logic for approval owners, the information you’d like to collect (including business justifications), automatic provisioning without approvals, and more for each software.
Based on your configured approvals workflows, the correct approver will automatically get notifications with the right level of detail to approve or deny the request in chat.

Your IT team should spend their time on high-impact projects that matter, like unlocking accounts and troubleshooting devices.

HR support requires deep understanding and personalization. That’s why Moveworks for HR is built with layers of machine learning models. Our AI analyzes every request, and weighs every possible response in real time, from location and language preference to security permissions and role, to surface the best possible response for every request.
HR issues are rarely as simple as a question and an answer. While Moveworks autonomously resolves 65% of HR issues, some situations will always require a help desk agent to step in and assist. Moveworks’ AI understands HR, meaning it knows exactly what your employees need when they ask for help — however they ask for it. When an issue needs to be routed to a specialist, Moveworks seamlessly hands them off to the right person.
Employees aren’t thinking about complex support org structure when they have a question. They just want their questions answered and don’t want to search through multiple HR information systems their company might have. Moveworks for HR offers a single place for employees to get help across various departments and systems.
We support over 1,000 team members across the globe with different needs and circumstances. Moveworks navigates this complexity for us, which means our people get the personal touch they expect from HR, but without having to wait.

For organizations looking to build a self-service experience, understanding information gaps is critical. Moveworks helps your business uncover and understand key knowledge gaps, so your technical writers can fill them in.

Constantly updating caches within service portals or bots is a huge waste of time and resources. When your team updates a knowledge article, Moveworks automatically ingests the latest information. That means, your team is always getting the most up-to-date answer without any added effort from your team.
Finding the right answers should be easy for every employee. When your employee asks our AI chatbot a question, Moveworks searches through every article, provides personalized snippets of relevant information, and links to the full article.
By integrating scattered knowledge bases with AI, Broadcom’s employees can help themselves.

Moveworks automates away the most common support issues, including resetting passwords, unlocking accounts, editing email groups, filing forms, troubleshooting devices, and much, much more. It’s the only way to eliminate the cost of these L1 issues, once and for all.
Reducing your help desk support costs often creates a frustrating employee experience, whether you implement an automated phone system or outsource to an MSP. But Moveworks delivers white-glove support, since employees describe issues to our conversational AI bot just as they would to an agent.


Help desks often invest in self-service resources, such as troubleshooting guides and hardware request forms, only to watch employees submit the same volume of tickets as before. Moveworks digs through every single resource at your company to find the best solution to each issue — so you can finally see some ROI.

In theory, employees could solve a huge percentage of their support issues without involving the help desk — if only they knew where to look. Moveworks makes that theory a reality. Our platform serves up the most helpful solution to common requests from across your ITSM, IAM system, knowledge bases, and other tools.
 
When employees submit complex issues that require an expert to fix, Moveworks still speeds up the entire ticket lifecycle. Our AI chatbot handles the back-and-forth communication with employees to add comments, nudge agents, and check status, so your help desk doesn’t have to.
Large companies waste millions of dollars per year on unused software licenses — while employees who really do need a software license often wait days to get access. Moveworks lets you take back control. Our platform provisions software in seconds, obtains approval when necessary, and reclaims licenses that employees don’t need.

"We’ve had our eye on AI and ML for some time, and Moveworks is the first service that actually improves IT service delivery— delivers the right resolution faster— while reducing costs."

Moveworks provides true multilingual support to employees in their native tongue — no training required. Employees can get help instantly, just by asking. Because Moveworks doesn’t follow a script, when employees switch languages, our platform adapts on a dime.
Moveworks is a one-stop shop for any employee to submit any issue, in any language. Our platform goes well beyond translation to interpret enterprise jargon, including conference room names, email groups, and company policies. It’s engineered to understand the way employees request help at work.
Moveworks provides the right solution to employees’ requests, such as snippets from knowledge articles in the appropriate language.
Our platform ingests thousands of support resources, the moment they’re published, so employees don’t need to go digging for what they need.
Languages fully supported by the Moveworks platform

Moveworks is designed to engage employees on their terms, without following a script. Our platform can switch languages and determine the ideal response on the fly — using machine learning models trained on more than 250 million support requests.
Especially with a multilingual workforce, your support platform needs to hold dynamic conversations to resolve every unique issue. That’s why our conversation engine continuously learns from each interaction, allowing Moveworks to provide a simple, unscripted experience to employees around the world.
Moveworks uses advanced natural language understanding (NLU) to determine exactly what employees need. By building upon our deep knowledge of enterprise terminology, our platform can interpret requests however they’re phrased.
Employees can file tickets in any language of their choice. Our platform automatically translates their ticket so any agent can quickly understand the issue. Once the issue is resolved, Moveworks translates the entire ticket back to English to ensure system compliance.
Support teams create knowledge articles that contain an incredible level of detail. To make that information accessible to employees, we evolved our semantic search system to find the relevant snippet of information across multiple languages.
After your employees have been helped, you can find out exactly what issues are slowing your team down with our advanced insights tools.

"As a global company, we need to provide the same quality of support to every employee at Albemarle to empower their potential, no matter which languages they speak. Moveworks gives our people 24/7 help in their native language — just by having a natural conversation with the bot. Now, they can get support right away, without us needing localized service desks in each location."

Varun Singh, Co-Founder and President

Let’s not fool ourselves. The massive number of apps and workflows deployed by modern enterprises has made it increasingly difficult to work efficiently. 
Toggling between fragmented systems has become the norm, with most employees spending a significant amount of time just learning to navigate the latest platform, not knowing how to execute even the most basic tasks or even which app has the information they need.
How do you solve this challenge at scale across the hundreds of workflows you've built and all the knowledge articles you've written? Creating custom use cases can be a real headache, demanding immense manual labor and technical know-how. It can take several months or even years to just launch one.
Moveworks' new Creator Studio is set to change all of that.  
Launching today, Creator Studio is a generative, no-code platform that connects employees to every system and application across the enterprise with a unified, natural language interface.
With Creator Studio, the people who know your business best — service owners, system owners, and enterprise architects across teams and departments — can create custom conversational AI use cases in minutes, all without the need for coding, scripting, or complex dialogue flows.
And you’ll be able to deploy everywhere. Each new use case built with Creator Studio will be available in collaboration tools, including Microsoft Teams, Slack, Whatsapp, Facebook, and more. This also includes support for various modes of communication, like text, voice, and image, with on-the-fly translation in over 100 languages.
Starting today, language will serve as a universal interface that enables employees to bypass the complexities of enterprise ecosystems, search for information, and take action across every application simply by asking. Companies like Coca-Cola Consolidated and Power Design are already leveraging Creator Studio to use language as the primary interface for all apps, systems, workflows, and automations.
Interested in learning more? Schedule a demo! In the meantime, to give you an idea of what's possible, let me highlight the three key Creator Studio workspaces: Paths, Queries, and Events.
 
Paths workspace is a powerful no-code tool that allows teams to create fully controllable, generative, and custom conversations about specific, frequently requested topics.
Traditional conversational AI toolkits can be complex and difficult to work with, often requiring extensive technical knowledge and scripting expertise. But with Paths, teams can easily describe the use case they need, and the platform's advanced generative AI and natural language processing capabilities will take care of the rest.
Figure 1: With Creator Studio Paths, you can generate customer conversational AI use cases with natural language.
Paths makes it possible for anyone to use a system conversationally. Let’s look at expense management. Instead of finding the right app and figuring out the new user interface, employees to access their expense reports conversationally, saving time and effort for both themselves and their managers.
Other use cases include: 
Figure 2: Enable your employees to access their expenses with a simple question with Creator Studio.
 
In today's fast-paced business world, data is king. But the sheer amount of information siloed away in countless systems and applications can make it difficult for employees to quickly access the insights they need. That's where Queries come in.
With Queries workspace, employees can access data from any system, app, or workflow across their organization in just a few clicks. Whether you need to check the status of a sales deal in your CRM or see the latest updates on a project in your project management tool, Queries has you covered. Say goodbye to juggling endless apps and systems and hello to fast, efficient access to the data you need to get your job done.
Figure 3: With Creator Studio Queries, you can securely access data from any system. 
With the ability to enable data queries across applications, Creator Studio can enhance efficiency and productivity for employees, including the Sales team. For example, by allowing the applicable employee to query Salesforce data, Creator Studio can surface essential account information, freeing up time for more impactful analyses and prospect conversations.
Other use cases include: 
Figure 4: Creator Studio lets anyone query Salesforce data so your team can focus on more impactful analyses.
 
Keeping on top of important events can be a real challenge, especially when you're juggling multiple tasks at once.
With Events workspace, you can integrate with any application to streamline notifications and send proactive, actionable recommendations to help you stay on top of things before they slip through the cracks. From timely reminders about employee anniversaries to suggestions for cleaning up your disk space, Events helps you prioritize your work and stay ahead of the game.
Figure 5: With Creator Studio Events, you can send proactive, actionable recommendations.
From a user-experience perspective, Creator Studio helps employees act quickly in the face of critical events. With its rapid incident escalation capabilities, your team can resolve issues quickly and with minimal disruption.
Other use cases include: 
Figure 6: Creator Studio helps developers to rapidly escalate business critical incidents.
 
The field of conversational AI has been transformed in recent years by using large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. Leveraging these advancements, Creator Studio offers an enterprise-ready platform that is both highly effective and infinitely scalable. 
Acting as a layer on top of your enterprise apps, Creator Studio allows users to communicate and take control of systems and applications using natural language. With seamless communication between each system and application, Moveworks can take action based on user needs, increasing efficiency and productivity. 
Compared to existing conversational AI toolkits, such as rules-based chatbots, Creator Studio is user-friendly and highly effective. Traditional solutions often require a great deal of technical expertise, precise coding of dialog flows, and are challenging to restructure. 
On the other hand, Creator Studio removes the need for dialogue flows altogether and instead harnesses the power of generative AI and best-in-class LLMs, like GPT 3.5 and GPT-4 — grounded by the Moveworks enterprise graph to improve robustness and reduce hallucinations — to generate any custom conversational AI use case. It is an enterprise-ready platform that facilitates easy implementation.
 
At Moveworks, our dedication to pushing the boundaries of this technology is exemplified through our early access to the world's most advanced large language models (LLMs) on the market.
We've been leveraging the power of LLMs and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) for several years, and our latest innovation, Creator Studio, builds on this foundation of best-in-class LLMs, proprietary NLU, AI, and machine learning technology.
One of the unique features of Creator Studio is our use of multiple LLMs instead of just one. This approach is similar to having a toolbox with different tools, each suited for different tasks. Multiple LLMs with different specializations and abilities enhance their performance and better suit them for specific tasks. Using multiple LLMs provides a broader range of perspectives and knowledge, leading to more well-rounded and accurate outputs.
With LLMs and NLU, we've changed the way conversational AI is used by the enterprise. Creator Studio is merely the latest example of how. With Creator Studio, our customers can use our out-of-the-box solutions or build customized conversational AI solutions tailored to their specific needs. This is achieved through cutting-edge LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 and generative AI, which connect disparate apps and workflows across enterprises and allows users to create custom conversational AI use cases in minutes, without the need for coding, scripting, or complex dialogue flows.
We're proud to be pioneers in using LLMs for conversational AI and look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of this technology.
 
Creator Studio marks a significant milestone in the evolution of conversational AI for the enterprise. Its powerful combination of large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning technologies empowers enterprises to create highly-effective, infinitely-scalable, and personalized conversational AI solutions in minutes without requiring extensive technical expertise.
With its user-friendly interface, Creator Studio radically simplifies the creation of customizable workflows, streamlining the design and deployment of conversational AI applications across different use cases and industries. By democratizing the power of conversational AI, Creator Studio is set to transform how enterprises interact with their customers and employees.
To experience the full potential of Creator Studio, interested parties can schedule a demo with the Moveworks team. Whether you're looking to optimize your IT service desk, HR support, or sales operations, Creator Studio can help you easily achieve your goals.

Available across every channel and fluent in 100+ languages, your enterprise copilot makes it easier than ever for your employees to get things done.

Unlike every other reporting tool you’ve seen, Employee Experience Insights works by investigating the unstructured language in your support tickets, then visualizes the most important problems slowing down your workforce. Finally, you’ll see the experiences behind the services you deliver.
EXI lets you dig deeper than ever before into how your investments in applications, systems, and support teams are performing, relative to benchmarks from your peers. That means you can change a confusing process, migrate to a different tool, or launch a new initiative — with total confidence.
Now, you can identify the key challenges facing each individual department, from marketing to engineering to sales. EXI puts you in control of your employee experience: you can share insights and prove impact with a single click.
There are endless features for your team to explore in Employee Experience Insights. Here are three of our favorites:
Our Employee Issues Map condenses thousands of unique issues into a powerful bird’s-eye view, where you can instantly spot opportunities to accelerate a process or prevent a problem in advance. And once you’ve locked in on a particular category, EXI enables you to find the root cause — with a granular breakdown of every type of issue in that category.
EXI allows you to track the critical indicators of your employee experience — such as average issues per employee, time to resolution, and first-contact resolution rate — against real-world benchmarks. By spending just a few minutes of your week in EXI, you’ll develop a data-driven, expert perspective on how to create a workplace that’s truly world-class.
The ability to filter EXI by departments, groups, and timeframes is a game-changer. You can now determine which issues are slowing down your sales team, your new hires, or your remote employees, at any moment in time. These personas are created by ingesting identity tables from across your systems of record, enabling you to define custom cohorts.
My job is to empower our digital workforce with the tools and technologies they need to perform at their best. With Moveworks' sophisticated NLU and Employee Experience Insights, we have meaningful and actionable data to turn thousands of requests into an efficient plan of action — and a best-in-class employee experience.

A $20 billion company with offices and facilities around the globe, Broadcom designs, develops, and manufactures a wide range of semiconductor and infrastructure software products.
Integrating new systems into existing IT environment 
Able to resolve more than half of all tech issues in under a minute 
The Problem
Broadcom is a global infrastructure technology company with a long history of innovation. Over the years, the organization has been aggressive about expansion, resulting in a number of mergers and acquisitions.
Andy Nallappan, Vice President and CIO at Broadcom, has seen his company undergo incredible growth and transformation over the years; however, the acquisitions Broadcom has made over the last decade present integration challenges. Information was spread across 10 different knowledge bases, making it difficult for employees to find the right information.

As employees rely on an ever-growing number of SaaS applications to keep pace with the fast-moving business, quickly answering their IT questions has never been more critical. They are expected to be increasingly self-sufficient when finding the knowledge they need — like changing their virtual background on Zoom or troubleshooting error messages on Slack. The problem is that knowledge is scattered. And even if employees manage to find the right knowledge base, outdated search systems make it difficult to find the right article.

The Solution
In September 2018, Broadcom launched 1.Bot, the company’s internal name for Moveworks. Employees were instantly able to use Google Chat to resolve a variety of issues like resetting passwords, unlocking accounts, creating tickets, checking ticket status, and finding answers from knowledge base articles.
Now, Moveworks’ combination of advanced conversational AI and natural language understanding (NLU) enables 1.Bot to resolve employees’ IT support issues conversationally, directly in chat. When the best solution to an issue is in the knowledge base, Moveworks Semantic Search understands the employee’s symptoms to provide the exact, snippet-sized answer they need.
You don’t want your users going all over the place to search for information. The advantage of our Moveworks bot is that there’s one familiar go-to place for employees to get their answers.
Stanley Toh
Head of End-User Services & Experience
The Result
With an integrated knowledge base, 57% of Broadcom’s IT issues are solved in less than a minute
A few years ago, Broadcom set out a vision to integrate the help desk experience for its employees, save time, and reduce the volume of work by automating tasks with AI. In the last two years alone, its IT team has systematically improved its knowledge base using Moveworks’ AI platform. 

Today, 1.Bot surfaces answers for employees in less than a minute, pulling information from across all the different knowledge bases and surfacing it in a single interface, Google Chat.

With real time visibility over knowledge base gaps, Broadcom's team can create new articles, or update old ones, so employees can self-service their own support. The help desk no longer feels like the "helpless" desk.

Nallappan’s overall impression of Moveworks is simple and powerful:

“It’s AI that really works.”

Jiang Chen,  Co-Founder and VP of Machine Learning

ChatGPT is a groundbreaking technology that’s captured the world’s imagination with its ability to show off the magic of AI.
Capable of generating human-like responses on the fly and demonstrating powerful reasoning, this technology’s crossed a threshold. Almost overnight, toolkit chatbots seem as obsolete as dial-up internet and floppy disks.
That said — ChatGPT and, by extension, large language models (LLMs) are not without their limitations. To truly leverage the full potential of the technology, we need to understand what they do well — and perhaps more importantly, what their limitations are.
My belief, and the one that we’re betting on at Moveworks, is that ChatGPT has kicked off an innovation race that is going to accelerate technological developments faster than most people are anticipating. The model underpinning ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, along with its successor, GPT-4, and other generative AI models are about to power a wave of innovation in conversational AI. 
My team and I at Moveworks have been experimenting with generative AI for a while now and we're excited about the impact these models can have on our customers over the coming months.
Today, I’m just going to give you a high-level view. You’ll leave understanding why ChatGPT is a game-changer in the world of conversational AI. And you’ll leave understanding why mitigating the potential downsides of large language models isn’t exactly a trivial exercise. 
 
Given my decades-long experience working on search and conversational AI engines, I have seen one breakthrough after another. Still, seeing and experiencing the power of large language models via ChatGPT is nothing short of awe-inspiring. 
Ten years ago, it took a team of highly talented researchers and engineers working hundreds, if not thousands, of hours building and training layers of machine learning algorithms — ASR, Translation, Spell Correction, Entity Recognition, Entity Resolution, Intent Classification, Slot Filling, Search, Question Answering, Dialog Policy, and more — to make sense of natural conversation. Each layer is the result of hours of masterfully designed experiments. It was incredibly complex work.
Let me try to put this in perspective. For generations, to create a high-quality watch you needed a combination of expert craftsmanship, specialized machinery, high-quality materials, and attention to detail. The design and engineering of the watch must be carefully planned, the various components of the watch must be precision-manufactured, and finally, the watch must be carefully assembled and tested to ensure that it is keeping accurate time. 
Just as the gears in a watch must be precisely manufactured, each with its own unique shape and size, machine learning algorithms must be carefully designed and implemented to perform specific tasks. But large language models, like the GPT-3 model powering ChatGPT, are shifting that paradigm. Instead of having a team of people working to create layers of algorithms that link together, one singular model is doing what many, many different systems had to do before. In essence, having a conversation with ChatGPT is like 3D printing a Swiss watch. Suddenly — everyone has the knowledge and reasoning power of LLMs at their fingertips.
We have been on this path for a few years following the release of OpenAI’s GPT-2, GPT-3, and Codex, as well as other LLMs. But there hasn’t been one that can generate responses as polished as ChatGPT until now. It took LLMs into the mainstream, putting their next-level sophistication in a package that’s accessible to everyone. Some clear examples for why I believe it's remarkable include how it:
LLMs have brought about impressive advances in AI and have the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries. However, understanding their nuances is crucial in using them in real-world applications. Let me explain:
 
ChatGPT can deliver some mind-blowingly accurate responses to questions. It can understand long, complex requests and then generate succinctly summarized responses that perfectly address the question. That is the real magic of ChatGPT. And it performs this feat a large majority of the time. 
The challenge is that the remaining percent of the time the responses are not just "a little off", they can be factually inaccurate and in some cases completely made up. This is an interesting dilemma, not just for ChatGPT but for LLMs in general. In fact, there’s a term for when LLMs sometimes generate factually incorrect statements: hallucination.
You could give ChatGPT one hundred percent of the context needed to give you the right answer, and it will still surface the wrong answer. In the example below, I’ve told the bot that 1-800-APLCARE is a real support line, and it responds “1-800-APLCARE is not a real Apple support line" and then contradicts itself in the following sentence stating, yes, "the correct number to call for Apple support is 1-800-275-2273 (1-800-APL-CARE)."

Quoting from different sources can’t solve the problem either since the model often takes sentences out of context and reassembles them into a paragraph to create an incorrect answer. In the instance below, the pricing of g4dn.xlarge is grafted to g4dn.4xlarge. 

The subtlety of these inaccuracies can appear innocent but have much broader implications when dealing with more sensitive subjects. To the untrained eye, incorrect statements could very well seem true. In its research, OpenAI acknowledges this challenge, stating that hallucination poses a very real threat when LLMs are used for real-world applications — like responding to employee questions in a business setting or providing automated patient support in a healthcare setting.
Adding to the challenge, no one can predict when it will hallucinate. This nuance is why it’s important to carefully consider which types of use cases ChatGPT, and LLMs in general, are currently suited to and which might require more thought. 
LLMs are genuinely amazing tools. But their truthfulness needs improvement to be used widely in the enterprise. And if these models generate answers that are not faithful to the input data in business-critical situations, the results could be catastrophic — legally, financially, and otherwise. Wasted time and resources, misguided troubleshooting, data loss, and even equipment damage could occur.
That’s why it is so important to layer models, processes, and guardrails that are capable of refining the inputs and controlling for the outputs on top of LMMs. Only then can you guarantee the truthfulness of their results. That is why most current out-of-the-box applications of LLMs, like copy generation and co-pilot, require human oversight. They can’t be trusted to provide fully automated support yet.
 
LLMs know a lot, and they can do a lot. One of the most amazing things about ChatGPT is that you don't need to be a machine learning expert to get the LLM that it is built on top of to do magical things. Anyone can type in a prompt and get an immediate response. 
This ability is a result of the fact that LLMs are general models designed to perform a wide range of tasks and adapt to new environments — not a narrow set of tasks. As such, they are the result of fusing layers and layers of algorithms, and that’s where it gets complex.  While this approach of fusing layers of models together dramatically shortens the time required to build and train complex systems, it offers limited ability to control the model's responses. 
Controllability refers to the ability of a system to be directed or brought to a specific state using a specific input. Just like a car on a straight road, a LLM has a specific state, which in this case is the internal representation of the text it generates. The inputs to the model are the text prompts given to it and the corresponding outputs are the text it generates.
Just as the car driver can apply the accelerator and the brake to change the car's position and velocity, the user can provide different prompts to the language model to generate different outputs. However, just as a car driver cannot control every aspect of the car's movement, such as traffic or the road conditions, users of a LLM also have limited control over the output. The model is trained on a large dataset and is able to generate a wide variety of responses, but the specific outcome is not always predictable.

Adding to that challenge, programming an LLM is currently limited to writing prompts. But, as visualized by the diagram above, written prompts are limited. At this time, prompt length can’t exceed 2048 tokens. While that number could extend, it doesn’t address the core challenge of only being able to communicate with LLMs via text-based prompts of limited size.
On the contrary, the communication bandwidth between the traditional layered intelligent system and the enterprise environment is much higher than LLMs can provide and offer more opportunities for us to control, fine-tune and override the behaviors. 
That’s why I predict there will be a more programmable and higher bandwidth interface opening up for LLMs. For example, LLMs might allow people to input embeddings instead of prompts.
For an intelligent system to thrive in a business setting, it needs to live and breathe the enterprise environment that it is designed to serve. To return to my car analogy, businesses need to be in the driver’s seat so that they can weather their own unique traffic. Controllability is necessary and LLMs must form part of a larger AI architecture that adds control and fine-tuning, offers further training and evaluation processes, and combines alternative machine learning approaches. That’s when things will get interesting.
 
To be able to deliver such an amazing experience, LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data. GPT-3, for example, is trained on a whopping 45 terabytes of text data from different datasets. However, training data are typically drawn from a specific time period and may not accurately reflect the current state of the world or the latest developments.
To go deeper — LLMs learn both reasoning capabilities and associative memory of the knowledge they are trained on. Reasoning and memory are inseparable and are both required to perform a given task. The associated memory is stuck in the time period in which it was trained, and there’s no easy overriding mechanism to update it except for spending millions of dollars to retrain them.
For example, if an LLM was trained on data from 2020, like GPT3.5, the model ChatGPT is built on top of, and was asked about a current event that occurred in 2022, it wouldn’t be able to generate an accurate or relevant response. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was launched in 2021, revealing the universe in a way never before seen by the world. If you were to ask ChatGPT about this telescope’s discoveries today, the bot would give an irrelevant answer, stating: “...it hasn’t had time to make any scientific discoveries yet.” Which we could say is categorically old news.

Even though people are attempting to put a search engine underneath it to bring in fresh data, it isn’t easy to instruct the LLM to override parts of the model’s knowledge while retaining the other in order to generate an up-to-date answer. There is no guarantee that an LLM won’t give out stale information even though the search engine it is paired with has up-to-date information. This poses a novel and unique challenge, especially with respect to a business setting, where most of the information is private and changes in real-time.
 
ChatGPT is a black swan event resulting from years of explosive progress in the field of AI. It has opened the eyes of machine learning veterans like myself to what is possible.
However, it’s essential to recognize that ChatGPT and large language models require a lot of sophistication and understanding of their nuances in order to successfully apply them in business-critical, domain-specific, or real-time applications. Make no mistake, the potential for ChatGPT to drive innovation and drive businesses forward makes it an essential technology for any AI company worth its salt. If you're not exploring and investing in it now, you’re going to be left behind.

                      A chat interface built on top of GPT-3.5. GPT-3.5 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that is trained on a massive amount of internet text data and fine-tuned to perform a wide range of natural language tasks. Example: GPT-3.5 has been fine-tuned for tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering.
                    

                      
                      Chatbot
                      
                    

                      A user-friendly interface that allows the user to ask questions and receive answers. Depending on the backend system that fuels the chatbot, it can be as basic as pre-written responses to a fully conversational AI that automates issue resolution.
                    

                      
                      Controllability
                      
                    

                      Controllability is the ability to understand, regulate, and manage an AI system's decision-making process, ensuring its accuracy, safety, and ethical behavior, and minimizing the potential for undesired consequences.
                    

                      
                      Conversational AI
                      
                    

                      A subfield of AI that focuses on developing systems that can understand and generate human-like language and conduct a back-and-forth conversation.

                      Cost of Large Language Models
                      
                    

                      The cost of large language models primarily stems from their size and complexity, which demand significant computational power, storage, and resources for training and deployment. These factors can result in substantial expenses for building, maintaining, and using such models, sometimes amounting to several dollars per conversation or thousands of dollars per month. 
                    

                      
                      Data Augmentation
                      
                    

                      Data Augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size and diversity of a training set by creating modified copies of the existing data. It involves making minor changes such as flipping, resizing, or adjusting the brightness of images, to enhance the dataset and prevent models from overfitting. 
                    

                      
                      Deep Learning
                      
                    

                      A subfield of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn from data. Example: A deep learning model that can recognize objects in an image by processing the image through multiple layers of neural networks.
                    

                      
                      Deterministic Model
                      
                    

                      A deterministic model follows a specific set of rules and conditions to reach a definite outcome, operating on a cause-and-effect basis.
                    

                      
                      Discriminative Models
                      
                    

                      Models that classify a data example and predict a label. For example, a model that identifies whether a picture is a dog or a cat.
                    

                      
                      Fine Tuning
                      
                    

                      The process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task by training it on a smaller dataset. For example, an image classification model trained on all intersection pictures can be fine turned to detect when a car runs a red light. At Moveworks, we’ve been fine-tuning LLMs for enterprise support for years.
                    

                      
                      Foundation Model
                      
                    

                      Foundation models are a broad category of AI models which include large language models and other types of models such as computer vision and reinforcement learning models. They are called "foundation" models because they serve as the base upon which applications can be built, catering to a wide range of domains and use cases.
                    

                      
                      GPT-3
                      
                    

                      GPT-3 is the 3rd version of the GPT-n series of models. It has 175 billion parameters — knobs that can be tuned — with weights to make predictions. Chat-GPT uses GPT-3.5, which is another iteration of this model.
                    

                      
                      GPT-4
                      
                    

                      GPT-4 is the latest model addition to OpenAI's deep learning efforts and is a significant milestone in scaling deep learning. GPT-4 is also the first of the GPT models that is a large multimodal model, meaning it accepts both image and text inputs and emits text outputs.
                    

                      
                      Generative AI
                      
                    

                      Generative AI models create new data by discovering patterns in data inputs or training data. For example, creating an original short story based on analyzing existing, published short stories.
                    

                      
                      Generative adversarial networks (or "GANs")
                      
                    

                      GANs are a powerful type of neural network capable of generating new, never-seen-before data that closely resembles the training data.
                    

                      
                      Generative Pre-trained Transformer (or “GPT”)
                      
                    

                      A type of deep learning model trained on a large dataset to generate human-like text, the underlying architecture of ChatGPT
                    

                      
                      Grounding
                      
                    

                      Grounding is the process of anchoring artificial intelligence (AI) systems in real-world experiences, knowledge, or data. The objective is to improve the AI's understanding of the world, so it can effectively interpret and respond to user inputs, queries, and tasks. Grounding helps AI systems become more context-aware, allowing them to provide better, more relatable, and relevant responses or actions.
                    

                      
                      Hallucination
                      
                    

                      Hallucination refers to a situation wherein an AI system, especially one dealing with natural language processing, generates outputs that may be irrelevant, nonsensical, or incorrect based on the input provided. This often occurs when the AI system is unsure of the context, relies too much on its training data, or lacks a proper understanding of the subject matter.
                    

                      
                      Instruction-tuning 
                      
                    

                      Instruction-tuning is an approach where a pre-trained model is adapted to perform specific tasks by providing a set of guidelines or directives that outline the desired operation.
                    

                      
                      Large Language Model (or “LLM”)
                      
                    

                      A type of deep learning model trained on a large dataset to perform natural language understanding and generation tasks. There are many famous LLMs like BERT, PaLM, GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and the groundbreaking GPT-4. All of these models vary in size (number of parameters that can be tuned), in the breadth of tasks (coding, chat, scientific, etc.), and in what they're trained on.
                    

                      
                      Low-code
                      
                    

                      Low-code is a visual approach to software development that enables faster delivery of applications through minimal hand-coding.
                    

                      
                      Machine Learning (or “ML”)
                      
                    

                      A subfield of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable machines to improve their performance with experience. Example: A machine learning algorithm that can predict which customers are most likely to churn based on their past behavior.
                    

                      
                      Multi-hop Reasoning
                      
                    

                      Multi-hop is a term often used in natural language processing and, more specifically, machine reading comprehension tasks. It refers to the process by which an AI model retrieves answers to questions by connecting multiple pieces of information present in a given text or across various sources and systems, rather than directly extracting the information from a single passage. 
                    

                      
                      Multimodal Language Model
                      
                    

                      Similar to a large language model, a multimodal language model is a type of deep learning model trained on large datasets, but unlike large language models which are only trained on textual data, multimodal language models are trained on both textual and non-textual data. This allows it to generate responses to multiple input modalities, like text, images, audio, and video.
                    

                      
                      N-Shot Learning
                      
                    

                      Zero/Single/Few shot learning are variations of the same concept – providing a model with little or no training data to classify new data and guide predictions. A “shot” represents a single training example. Fun fact: Within the GPT prompt, you can ask for “N” examples to improve the accuracy of the response. 
                    

                      
                      Natural Language Ambiguity
                      
                    

                      Natural language ambiguity refers to situations where a word, phrase, or sentence can have multiple meanings, making it challenging for both humans and AI systems to interpret correctly. 
                    

                      
                      Natural Language Generation (or “NLG”)
                      
                    

                      A subfield of AI that produces natural written or spoken language. 
                    

                      
                      Natural Language Processing (or “NLP”)
                      
                    

                      A subfield of AI that involves programming computers to process massive volumes of language data. Focuses on transforming free-form text into a standardized structure.
                    

                      
                      Natural Language Understanding (or “NLU”)
                      
                    

                      A subtopic of NLP that analyzes text to glean semantic meaning from written language. That means understanding context, sentiment, intent, etc.
                    

                      
                      Neural Network
                      
                    

                      A machine learning model inspired by the human brain's structure and function that's composed of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons." Example: A neural network that can recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy.
                    

                      
                      No-code
                      
                    

                      No-code is an approach to designing and using applications that doesn't require any coding or knowledge of programming languages.
                    

                      
                      OpenAI
                      
                    

                      The organization that developed ChatGPT. More broadly speaking, OpenAI is a research company that aims to develop and promote friendly AI responsibly. Example: OpenAI's GPT-3 model is one of the largest and most powerful language models available for natural language processing tasks.
                    

                      
                      Optimization
                      
                    

                      The process of adjusting the parameters of a model to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the model's predictions and the true values. Example: Optimizing a neural network's parameters using a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the true values.
                    

                      
                      Overfitting
                      
                    

                      A problem that occurs when a model is too complex, performing well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Example: A model that has memorized the training data instead of learning general patterns and thus performs poorly on new data.
                    

                      
                      Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (or "PEFT")
                      
                    

                      Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, also known as PEFT, is an approach that helps you improve the performance of large AI models while optimizing for resources like time, energy, and computational power. To do this, PEFT focuses on adjusting a small number of key parameters while preserving most of the pretrained model's structure.

                    

                      
                      Pre-training
                      
                    

                      Training a model on a large dataset before fine-tuning it to a specific task. Example: Pre-training a language model like ChatGPT on a large corpus of text data before fine-tuning it for a specific natural language task such as language translation.
                    

                      
                      Probabilistic Model
                      
                    

                      A probabilistic AI model makes decisions based on probabilities or likelihoods.
                    

                      
                      Prompt Engineering
                      
                    

                      Identifying inputs — prompts — that result in meaningful outputs. As of now, prompt engineering is essential for LLMs. LLMs are a fusion of layers of algorithms and, consequently, have limited controllability with few opportunities to control and override behavior. An example of prompt engineering is providing a collection of templates and wizards to direct a copywriting application.
                    

                      
                      Reasoning
                      
                    

                      AI reasoning is the process by which artificial intelligence systems solve problems, think critically, and create new knowledge by analyzing and processing available information, allowing them to make well-informed decisions across various tasks and domains.
                    

                      
                      Recursive Prompting
                      
                    

                      Recursive prompting is a strategy for guiding AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4 to produce higher-quality output. It involves providing the model with a series of prompts or questions that build upon previous responses, refining both the context and the AI's understanding to achieve the desired result. 

                    

                      
                      Reinforcement Learning
                      
                    

                      A type of machine learning in which a model learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties. GPT uses reinforcement learning from human feedback. When tuning GPT-3, human annotators provided examples of the desired model behavior and ranked outputs from the model.
                    

                      
                      Responsible AI
                      
                    

                      Responsible AI refers to the approach of creating, implementing, and utilizing AI systems with a focus on positively impacting employees, businesses, customers, and society as a whole, ensuring ethical intentions and fostering trust, which in turn enables companies to confidently scale their AI solutions.
                    

                      
                      Sequence Modeling
                      
                    

                      A subfield of NLP that focuses on modeling sequential data such as text, speech, or time series data. Example: A sequence model that can predict the next word in a sentence or generate coherent text.
                    

                      
                      Speech-to-text
                      
                    

                      The process of converting spoken words into written text.

Unlike every other reporting tool you’ve seen, Employee Experience Insights works by investigating the unstructured language in your support tickets, then visualizes the most important problems slowing down your workforce. Finally, you’ll see the experiences behind the services you deliver.
EXI lets you dig deeper than ever before into how your investments in applications, systems, and support teams are performing, relative to benchmarks from your peers. That means you can change a confusing process, migrate to a different tool, or launch a new initiative — with total confidence.
Now, you can identify the key challenges facing each individual department, from marketing to engineering to sales. EXI puts you in control of your employee experience: you can share insights and prove impact with a single click.
There are endless features for your team to explore in Employee Experience Insights. Here are three of our favorites:
Our Employee Issues Map condenses thousands of unique issues into a powerful bird’s-eye view, where you can instantly spot opportunities to accelerate a process or prevent a problem in advance. And once you’ve locked in on a particular category, EXI enables you to find the root cause — with a granular breakdown of every type of issue in that category.
EXI allows you to track the critical indicators of your employee experience — such as average issues per employee, time to resolution, and first-contact resolution rate — against real-world benchmarks. By spending just a few minutes of your week in EXI, you’ll develop a data-driven, expert perspective on how to create a workplace that’s truly world-class.
The ability to filter EXI by departments, groups, and timeframes is a game-changer. You can now determine which issues are slowing down your sales team, your new hires, or your remote employees, at any moment in time. These personas are created by ingesting identity tables from across your systems of record, enabling you to define custom cohorts.
My job is to empower our digital workforce with the tools and technologies they need to perform at their best. With Moveworks' sophisticated NLU and Employee Experience Insights, we have meaningful and actionable data to turn thousands of requests into an efficient plan of action — and a best-in-class employee experience.

Every employee deserves instant support, no matter what language they speak. With Moveworks, employees get support in seconds — simply by asking for help in their native tongue. 
Most help desks struggle to support a global workforce: they process thousands of urgent requests from employees, at all hours of the day. But Moveworks resolves these requests in more than 100 languages, completely automatically, so your help desk can deliver high-speed support from Tokyo to Paris to Berlin.
Moveworks provides truly multilingual support to employees in their native language.
No training required: employees can get help just by asking. And when they switch languages, Moveworks adapts on a dime.
Moveworks is a one-stop shop for every employee to submit every issue — in every language. 
Our platform goes well beyond translation to interpret enterprise jargon, including conference room names, email groups, and company policies. It’s engineered to understand the way employees request help at work.
Moveworks provides the right solution to employees’ requests, such as snippets from knowledge articles in the appropriate language.
Our platform ingests thousands of support resources, the moment they’re published, so employees don’t need to go digging for what they need.
Moveworks has pioneered the first AI platform that engages employees in their native language, deeply understands their requests, and provides the right resources in real time.
Under the hood, we had to evolve the entire Moveworks Intelligence Engine™ to become multilingual:
Moveworks is designed to engage employees on their terms, without following a script. Now, our platform can switch languages and determine the ideal response on the fly — using machine learning models trained on more than 250 million support requests. 
Especially with a multilingual workforce, your support platform needs to hold dynamic conversations to resolve every unique issue. That’s why our conversation engine continuously learns from each interaction, allowing Moveworks to provide a simple, unscripted experience to employees around the world.
Moveworks uses advanced natural language understanding (NLU) to determine exactly what employees need. By building upon our deep knowledge of enterprise terminology, our platform can interpret requests however they’re phrased.
This level of NLU requires layers of machine learning models. Our approach allows Moveworks to detect languages with 98% accuracy, make sense of ambiguous entities, correct for grammar and spelling, and identify terms unique to each company.
Moveworks solves support issues end-to-end by scouring your company for the most useful solution — in the appropriate language. Our platform automatically ingests support resources the moment they’re live, then ranks them with probabilistic machine learning, based on their relevance for the employee. 
Support teams create knowledge articles that contain an incredible level of detail. To make that information accessible to employees, we evolved our semantic search system to find the relevant snippet of information across multiple languages.

Multi-LLM Strategy
Different large language models perform better at different tasks. You get access to the highest performing models, including: OpenAI’s GPT-4 for search relevance, Google’s BERT for intent classification, and Meta’s RoBERTa for entity recognition.
Enterprise Data
Most off-the-shelf LLMs are trained on public data, not your company’s data. Moveworks incorporates secure training data from 500M+ support tickets, 10B+ bot conversations, and 100M+ enterprise resources to ensure the language models understand the language of work.
Entity Grounding
To maximize factuality and minimize hallucinations from LLMs, you need to automatically send prompts to the LLM  with content of your business. Moveworks automatically mines company specific entities (identity maps, distribution lists, conference room names, software catalog, etc.) and provides that information in every prompt.
Broadcom is resolving 57%+ of IT issues while seeing a 40% reduction in incidents with Moveworks

Model evaluation
New models come out every day and perform better at specific tasks than old models. Moveworks is deeply ingrained in the latest research and has access to models before they’re publicly released, meaning we are able to automatically swap them out to maximize performance and accuracy.
Model fine-tuning
LLMs can’t be fine-tuned with your company data because most of them are too large to host on infrastructure. To perform better than LLMs at specific tasks in the enterprise, Moveworks fine-tunes smaller models with the language of work. This also results in lower latency for the end-user experience.
Model annotation
To get the most out of model performance, you need a team to constantly evaluate its performance. At Moveworks, we have a robust annotation operation where trained linguists securely review bot conversations and provide real-time feedback to the models.
Model infrastructure
Calling large language model APIs for every natural language task can be costly and provide a poor latency experience. Moveworks has built proprietary model infrastructure to host smaller models that are fine-tuned, allowing for better performance and minimal latency.
Conversation experience
Users speak naturally, and Moveworks understands. Whether it’s in any language, or the user wants to switch topics, or the user doesn’t know what they’re looking for, Moveworks handles the conversation in a delightful way.
Search and action reasoning
Businesses have a sea of resources to answer questions: knowledge articles, forms, structured information in backend systems, workflows, and more. Moveworks leverages LLMs to decide the best answer or combination of answers to provide.

Moveworks routes complicated support requests to the right expert or group — with 96% accuracy.
Using a bespoke machine learning model created for every single customer, our platform learns to distinguish between thousands of assignment groups. Now, issues start getting solved the moment they’re submitted.
On average, L1 service desks take 5 hours to read and then route employees’ support issues. But Moveworks automatically sends each issue to the correct assignment group within 30 seconds.
Our platform makes your queue disappear. Employees spend less time waiting for help — and more time on what matters.
Service desk agents have to remember hundreds or even thousands of assignment groups, which means that misrouted tickets are inevitable.
This is a problem made for machine learning. Our custom classification models are 96% accurate at routine tickets, and they never stop improving.
Every issue that Moveworks routes is work saved for the service desk. For large companies, that frees up millions of dollars to reallocate toward high impact projects.

A conversational AI strategy describes how companies implement and improve an automated process for supporting employees, using a conversational AI platform that resolves their requests.
Conversational AI has become a necessity in the workplace. AI platforms can resolve thousands of IT support issues, HR service requests, and policy questions at the speed employees expect while freeing up support teams to focus on high-impact projects.
Despite the importance of these platforms, there aren’t many resources about how to create an overall strategy for supporting employees with conversational AI, from increasing user adoption to addressing knowledge gaps. The leaders who succeed with AI develop a strategy that guides their technology decisions — not vice versa.
There are many factors worth considering to find the right AI platform for your business, including integrations, implementation time, analytics, and more. However, we recommend ranking employee experience as your top priority. If employees have a frustrating interaction with your conversational AI platform, they’ll never use it again — no matter its capabilities.
So what causes these frustrating interactions? Typically, they’re the product of the “do-it-yourself” approach to AI, where support teams build their own hard-coded dialog flows to address common requests and questions. The problem is that conversation can’t be hard-coded: companies evolve, resources become out-of-date, and users change topics without warning. As a result, it’s critical to work backward from an AI platform that engages with employees in unscripted conversations, rather than trying to solve a few specific use cases.
Here’s how Slack improved employee experience with conversational AI
Once you’ve deployed a conversational AI system that understands employees, you need to create self-service resources to resolve their issues. And because nearly 30% of these issues are knowledge-seeking questions, according to our internal data, the best place to start is optimizing your knowledge base for conversational AI.
When done correctly, every policy document, FAQ sheet, and troubleshooting guide is an opportunity to solve thousands of support issues — by surfacing the right snippet of text with AI. That means ensuring that each knowledge article covers only a single topic, is clearly organized into discrete sections, and is written with non-technical language.
When employees go searching for answers, the last thing they want to do is spend 20 minutes reading an article for the one sentence they need. A well-organized knowledge base allows your conversational AI platform to find that sentence automatically.
Read how Broadcom automated 55% of IT issues by optimizing its knowledge base
Beyond answering questions, an advanced conversational AI strategy allows companies to automate workflows and accelerate approvals. First, take the time to define how your team resolves common issues, such as provisioning software licenses and approving hardware orders. Which applications are involved? How do you enforce user permissions? And who needs to sign off?
By clearly documenting the entire process, you can often reduce or eliminate the need for agent intervention, even for high-touch issues. And for requests that do require an expert to solve, conversational AI can accelerate the process by routing the request to the appropriate team.
An effective conversational AI strategy is evolving — not static. Its foundation is data, which reveals the most frequent requests and questions from employees, the most valuable knowledge articles and forms, and the most impactful use cases for additional automation.
That’s why it’s crucial to have total visibility over your conversational AI platform, so you can not only understand but also anticipate what employees need. With this data in hand, you can build a positive feedback loop — where each issue submitted to the platform helps your team improve its future performance.
Here’s how Verisk makes data-driven decisions
Of course, all of this is for naught if your employees don’t use the conversational AI tool you’ve worked so hard to integrate. To drive employee engagement, make this tool the easiest possible thing to use. Have a clear employee adoption strategy, with every avenue of support integrated with your conversational AI system.
A great conversational AI strategy will keep the end-user in mind. It will help you to communicate with your employees with ease, without your messages getting ignored. Most importantly, implementing a conversational AI strategy should free your agents from busywork, and enable them to focus on deeper, more meaningful work. 
Implementing a conversational AI strategy is the future of employee experience. Every employee, regardless of location, language, or role, deserves the same level of support — and we hope this strategy overview helps you get there.

Effective knowledge base articles can save an organization millions of dollars and hours of wasted time. As an IT leader, you want your employees to get the help they need without having to file a ticket and wait hours and days. This is the goal of every knowledge base article.
A good knowledge article can help employees and agents alike — because self-service increases the productivity of the entire organization. We've helped hundreds of companies perfect their knowledge base, and now we're ready to share what we've learned.
There are three parts that come into play when writing a knowledge article:
The best knowledge base articles are easy to understand. So, we recommend establishing a clear writing style within your organization and enabling every person who writes knowledge base articles to use it.
The best articles:
The best headlines are simple and clear. Don't write titles that only focus on a problem's symptom — as they may vary across employees.
When writing headlines, mention the main subject prominently. If your organization uses two different communications platforms, include the name in your title. For example, "setting up Zoom video conferencing" is a clear title that lets the employees know exactly how they'll be helped.
Add contextual information only if it helps differentiate the article. For example: "setting up printers in the Austin office" vs "setting up printers in the Toronto office". Establish and use the same contextual information across all knowledge base articles.
Establish the context of each article immediately. For example, an article applying only to Mac OS users should state that upfront, preferably in the title. Don't rely on organizational hierarchies — tell the reader exactly how the article is relevant to them in the title and body of the article.
The best way to write an effective knowledge base article is to talk like your end-users. Try to use the terminology your employees use — including adding keywords that describe symptoms. For example, users may say "my laptop screen turned blue" — and if the resulting article doesn't list that symptom, they could assume the article won't resolve their issue.
To ensure you're using up-to-date terminology, check out these resources:
Don't add hyperlinks unless:
There are four types of knowledge base articles. Each should be written with the specific goal of enabling self-service.
Task-based articles provide general overviews of a process and use specific steps to guide employees toward a solution. Most of your knowledge base articles should be of this type.
To make it easier for users to find task-based articles, the title should follow the phrase "I want to know about...". For example, "How to connect to the VPN".
Intro articles will give employees beginner context about a system in your organization.
To convey that the article provides background information (rather than a how-to procedure), start the title with "about..." or "what is...".
Setting up a FAQ is an easy way to address common questions from employees, but to enable self-service, keep your answers short. If a question requires a lot of context or a task procedure is useful, it should have its own article.
These articles explain organizational-level policies or procedures. Choose a title that makes that clear. For example, good titles might start with "What's our policy for..." or "Can I..."
To truly enable self-service and see an impact on your help desk, you need to meet employees where they are — in enterprise chat platforms. Today, however, employees often revert to DMing their preferred IT agent or asking their questions within an existing IT channel.
You need to create a single interface for all knowledge — bypassing the frustration an employee feels when they don't know how to get the answers they need. At Consumers Energy, for example, employees are able to engage directly on their enterprise chat platform. They can ask any question from HR to IT and get an answer in minutes.
By following this checklist, you can effectively create a knowledge base article that enables self-service for your employees.

The goal of a successful help desk is to solve employee issues as fast as possible. There are many levers a CIO can pull to make that happen — integrations with various tech stacks, increasing the size of your team, or exploring alternative technologies.
To find the right lever, we analyzed 16 million support issues from customers BEFORE they implemented a Moveworks bot to determine what actions make the most impact across the board.
We set out to answer 3 specific questions:

Most IT desks don’t have overarching visibility into ticket categories. But this information is crucial if you truly want to optimize your support environment.
With this lack of insight in mind, we categorized millions of issues from nearly 50 enterprise companies. Then, we sorted them into the 5 channels: phone, portal, email, chat, and walk-up.

Based on our data, employees preferred to contact IT over the phone 44.2% of the time. We wanted to dig deeper into this — why did employees turn to the phone? Was it the most efficient channel? 

Next, we looked to see if there was a relationship between the type of issue and the support channel.
Let's look first at what we consider an urgent issue: password resets. We found that employees are most likely to call a help desk agent when locked out of an account — choosing the phone six times more often than other channels.
Clearly, employees believe they need to get on the phone with a help desk agent to get help quickly. 
To represent non-urgent issues, we dug into issues related to email distribution lists — a less time-sensitive problem. In this case, employees are twice as likely to turn to the portal channel.
Employees change their behavior based on the urgency of their issue — but is help actually faster from channel to channel?
Even though many believe talking to an agent on the phone is faster, we found that it takes agents almost the same amount of time to solve urgent issues over the phone as other channels.
On top of that, our data also shows that even when employees use what they perceive to be the fastest support channel, they still end up waiting multiple days for a solution.
As it turns out, the difference between channel speeds is marginal at best. Our data suggests that the quality of support from a particular channel has more to do with the type of issue submitted, than the efficiency of the channel itself.
This is because all channels tap into the same backend systems. Either an agent has to solve the problem manually or triages the ticket to someone else who can.
So, what's the one thing you can do to speed up your help desk?
Short answer: automation.
Long answer: The most impactful thing that IT support teams can do is shift their focus from improving individual channels to updating backend support systems. What teams should address is the process of solving issues behind the scenes — with automation.
By automating the backend support systems, you can build a strong foundation for improving specific channels or adding new ones.
With automation you can:
As you incorporate more automation, from troubleshooting to approvals, your time-to-resolution will continue to reduce. Let’s return to the password reset example. Automating account unlocks end-to-end ensures fast support while giving help desk agents more time to focus on higher priority projects, not routine issues.
When implemented, automation can help bring your help desk into a new era of support

Category-leading companies know that employee experience is important now more than ever. That’s why the best organizations pride themselves on being able to deliver incredible support to every employee — instantly.
But, only industry-leading organizations know how to deliver the best support while also:

In an era when personalized experiences are the norm, organizations are far behind in providing the same. Employees are burnt out. The last thing they need is to wait multiple days for help.
So, organizations are using service desk automation to unlock a frictionless employee experience and optimize the IT team.
Service desk automation is the process of using machine learning and conversational AI to streamline repetitive tasks. It provides service agents with a single platform to resolve customer issues with minimum effort so that they can focus on high-impact work. True automation will offer employees end-to-end support, without relegating your IT agents to building out workflows.
Right now, agents and employees alike are having a tough time solving for fast employee support.
Employees are unable to get fast support for three main reasons:
IT agents are overwhelmed because:
To solve all these issues, organizations are turning to an AI service desk and adopting knowledge centered services — with great results.
When it comes to introducing service desk automation into your organization, there are two approaches you can take:
There are benefits and challenges to both, so let’s dive in.
Some organizations choose to build tools in-house. This can offer up a lot of flexibility for service teams to incorporate edge cases, save money in the long run, and align your automation strategy with your organization’s “build in-house” culture.
If you have a large team of developers that are passionate about building dialogue flows, customizable scripts, and getting into the nitty-gritty of the building process, building your own tools can be beneficial.
It's important to consider what resources you have on offer before building your own in-house automation tool — this approach requires a lot of manual effort, but can be hugely beneficial in the long run.
Other organizations choose to implement an existing automation tool. the most effective way to rapidly scale your service desk, without piling work onto your IT team or having to onboard new members. Industry-leading organizations are choosing to pursue this route for many reasons, including:
No matter which way you choose to automate your service desk, there’s a whole host of benefits that can create a wide-ranging impact. Automation can easily transform your business processes and make your entire organization — from IT agents to employees — a more productive, happier workforce. Let’s take a closer look:
Employees are constantly interacting with existing business processes — through onboarding, requesting access, routine communications, and so much more. Automation is an opportunity to streamline all interactions employees have with the help desk to ease massive amounts of day-to-day friction.
Automation is also a massive cost-savings method. It takes, on average, 30 hours for a service desk agent to resolve a ticket, whereas automation can enable self-service and give agents back their time.

Right now, service desk agents may spend their days running after mundane tasks — resetting passwords, routing tickets, or directing people to the right knowledge base article. With service desk automation, organizations can turn the corner towards faster resolution without overburdening agents with manual help.
Automation can solve common problems instantly, dramatically reducing wait times for employees. Of course, there will always be issues that only a help desk agent can solve. While agents are working on that, you can automate standard employee communications — updating them on the ticket, and keeping them in the loop.
With the right automation strategy, you can even proactively engage with employees — solving issues before they become tickets, answering questions before they become blockers.
To put this into context, let’s apply these benefits to some everyday use cases.
Based on Moveworks data, we know that successful organizations use machine learning and automation for the following three use cases the most effectively:
These use cases come up on a daily basis and every employee is blocked by them multiple times during their tenure.
At first glance, an employee facing several challenges during their tenure doesn’t seem like a huge problem. But multiply that with every employee you have. And others who are blocked as a result. Easing day-to-day friction for every employee can be a game-changer.
Automation is able to alleviate that pain — and more — exponentially.

IT leaders want to provide fast, comprehensive support to their employees. To do that, they need powerful knowledge resources — and the means to track their effectiveness. In fact, we know that the best knowledge centered services are also the most organized and actionable.
But this presents a challenge: Agents struggle with knowledge management because it's hard to write, maintain, and track within the enterprise. So, how can we make sure our knowledge centered services are actually creating an impact? Keep reading to find out.
This guide will provide a comprehensive look into what knowledge centered service is, the benefits and challenges of providing it, and how you can incorporate it into your organization.
Organizations use knowledge centered service to gain visibility into every aspect of the knowledge support environment within their business. By managing, distributing, and tracking knowledge across the whole enterprise, leaders can more quickly resolve employees' problems — and in many cases, prevent incidents from happening before they arise.
In action, this looks like detailed documentation, knowledge sharing, and data-driven insights into how knowledge actually gets used.
Until recently, the more commonly used term was knowledge centered support. The focus of this process was always to offer the best customer and employee support, while also creating and maintaining documentation. 
Knowledge centered service was adopted to expand the focus from simply offering support to improving every aspect of the ITSM.
There are many reasons why KCS is the dominant way to run your help desk, but an overarching theme emerges time and time again: This system can scale your help desk even with limited resources. These three value-adds can help you do just that.
When implemented correctly, KCS can encourage your employees to self-serve when issues arise. Over time, your organization will have built up a library of knowledge articles, filled to the brim with solutions. And yet, your agents may find themselves answering the same questions time and time again.
KCS can enable employees to search for and find their own answers — dramatically reducing time to resolution.
Initially, KCS adoption requires some investment of time, but the time-saving potential of KCS in the post-adoption stage has a monumental impact in the long run. Building a service desk around knowledge will free your help desk agents from having to answer the same set of questions day after day. Instead, as they document solutions, other agents will be able to jump in and reference their approach — saving time and energy for everyone.
When KCS is implemented successfully, employee retention and satisfaction can increase dramatically. Employees get solutions faster — and often by themselves. Agents get to turn their attention to strategic work. It's a win-win.
As KCS both reduces the overall tickets by enabling self-service and the amount of time and effort each agent spends on resolving a ticket, this method can substantially cut your cost-per-ticket.
We've discussed some ways KCS can deliver tangible benefits to organizations — even with limited resources. However, successful implementation introduces some challenges too.
While companies do a great job of encouraging their agents to document solutions, they often fall short in helping employees find knowledge base articles. Useful articles get locked away behind confusing portals. Too many employees forget passwords. And the support environment can be so complex, that people give up searching for answers before they even start.
Ultimately, employees end up reaching out to their favorite IT agent or filing a ticket instead, waiting several hours or days for a resolution. Vice versa, IT agents end up referencing their own articles over and over, caught in an endless loop of mundane question-answering processes.
Articles are written by — and for — IT agents. In fact, our data shows that half of all articles are almost impossible to read given their length.
The cycle of knowledge article creation typically follows these steps:
Instead, industry-leading companies get very prescriptive about how to write knowledge base articles. They templatize what a good article looks like. Agents are enabled to write for employees — and self-service increases.
Many companies don't have metrics defining the success of a knowledge base article. They may track views — but have no way of connecting those views to the next course of action taken by employees who viewed the article. As a result, the IT team may report an increase in views on the knowledge articles they've been working on, even though ticket volume hasn't slowed down.
Clearly, there's a disconnect at play. Industry-leading companies clearly define what a good knowledge base article looks like, and how it’s effective. For example, if a particular article is getting a lot of views, tickets relating to that problem should see a drop in volume — an indication that employees are choosing the self-service route.
Many industry-average companies are aware of the task facing them: They need to overhaul how their employees approach support. But many IT leaders are discovering that it's hard to determine which knowledge topics actually yield impact for employees.
There are two big actions you can take to find and interpret these knowledge opportunities:
According to data across our customer base, 40% of issues employees raise go unanswered because of knowledge gaps.
While a knowledge gap may be evident to IT agents, it's often much less evident to leaders. By conducting a thorough content audit, however, you can connect the dots between what employees are actively searching for and what knowledge articles you have currently available.
All IT teams have a library of knowledge articles — but are all of them effective employee resources? To answer that question, conduct an audit of your existing articles, keeping an eye out for the following:
To be the most effective organization in building and maintaining KCS, leaders have to start thinking about knowledge as a service they’re providing to their employees.
Industry-leading companies often empower centralized knowledge teams to oversee the process of creating and maintaining knowledge. They also:
Ultimately, employees are looking for a seamless employee experience — they don’t want to wait several hours for simple tasks that block their productivity. Adopting knowledge centered services is a significant first step to addressing these concerns. 
To go beyond, consider creating a conversational AI strategy.

We’ve analyzed industry-average and industry-leading companies and found a large disparity between the two. Now, we turn our attention to hybrid work.
IT teams are starting to support a hybrid workforce for the first time while figuring out best practices. It’s difficult as employees are dependent on scattered technology, inter-company communication is challenging, and IT teams can only do so much in a day. 
Companies are exploring the hybrid work model best practices, and we’ve distilled the four main things industry-leading enterprises are doing to create a seamless transition. 
Whether or not we call it a recession, 2022 has been a difficult year for the economy. The US has seen the highest inflation since 1981. The S&P 500 is down 23%, which would be the fourth largest annual drop since the Great Recession era.
This economic volatility puts a lot of pressure on CIOs, who are no longer expecting their technology budgets to increase. Clearly, now is the time to think hard about where is the most valuable place to put dollars. According to CIO's 21st annual State of the CIO survey, industry leaders are using this budget in two big ways:
Employees need one place where they can get help — remote, in-person, or hybrid. The solution we've seen ground-breaking companies turn to is a digital headquarters. The digital HQ is a starting point for everything employees do at work, from holding meetings to sharing files to requesting support. This is different from digital tools, which are meant to support a particular task, such as Google Calendar for scheduling.
Having analyzed numerous industry-leading companies, we know that the best of them use an enterprise collaboration hub as the foundation for their digital HQ. Hybrid work best practices for building a digital HQ includes these concrete steps:
Industry leaders recognize the inequality of IT support within a global workforce — after all, not even the largest IT team can support every single employee, in every location, in every language. As employees decide to return to the office — or not — companies need to prioritize giving them everything they need to do their best work. A digital headquarters helps to make that transition effortless.
Across the globe, a crucial hybrid work best practice is investing in automation. Leaders are hesitant to grow their IT teams. Instead, they're leaning on automation to ease their existing IT team's burden, drive efficiency, and improve company productivity at the same time.
AI and automation can be your ticket to ensuring that your IT teams feel supported and not overworked while also offering white-glove support to your employees. Your AI tool of choice should allow you to:
The first step for technology leaders is to address IT-facing automation opportunities. Developing automation tools and scripts leads to substantial time savings, as proven by the CIO of Equinix, Milind Wagle. Where industry leaders rise to the challenge, however, is by paying careful attention to the final step of automation: enabling self-service for employees.
Successfully solving for self-service can and does take many forms. The core of the challenge — building out a knowledge base, empowering employees to take this new route, and reducing dependency on IT agents — remains the same. The results can bring significant cost savings. According to HDI, a support call can cost as much as $22, while self-service is $2 per incident.
Automation lets companies do more with less — support more employees, and increase the efficiency of a smaller IT department.
A hybrid work best practice is to battle communication exhaustion. Industry-leading companies are telling employees exactly what they need to know and meeting employees where they are. These two seemingly small shifts in strategies have shown to have monumental effects on employees and the business.
Employees are laden with messages — from their peers, their direct reports, managers, etc. There's a very likely chance that company-wide alerts get lost in their inbox, buried in portals, and overlooked due to irrelevancy.
To combat this, industry leaders are choosing to send out hyper-targeted messages based on their role, department, distribution lists, type of employee, location, and any other information that might be relevant to the communication.
Secondly, they use these hyper-targeted messages to drive action. They lead employees to exactly where they need to go. Need people to update their personal information? Add a link to the portal where they can do that. Innovative IT teams make it as easy as possible for people to complete an action.
More and more employees are spending the majority of their time on enterprise chat platforms. Slack and Microsoft teams have been the primary mode of immediate communication, while portals and emails have the reputation of being overlooked.
When employees need IT support in a hybrid work environment, they often don't have the luxury of walking over to their favorite IT agent. They have to muster thorough often chaotic backends.
With the shift to enterprise chat, industry leaders can:
At home, people are used to Netflix's personalized recommendations and Spotify's curated playlists. This lies in stark opposition to their experience at work — disjointed, clunky processes that largely wait for IT agents to comment on tickets.
Qualtrics research found that only 30% of employees say that their experience with their company's technology exceeds their expectations.
Hybrid work threw this problem into a new light. Across industries, companies were seeing a massive uptick in tickets as remote work began in March 2020. Now, as companies start to define hybrid work best practices, they're starting with back-end systems.
In large organizations, there are an increasing number of tools and portals that employees can use to their advantage. Except, employees don't know what to use. Industry leaders approach this problem at more than just the surface level.
The real problem lies in the disarrayed back-end systems. In automating and connecting the many back-end processes that exist in organizations, you can provide a cohesive front to your employees. And because your back-end systems will be ingesting information from every tool, you can drive adoption and usage across every software.
Data suggests the average enterprise uses 288 different SaaS apps across the board. Industry leaders optimize to reach the full potential of each software. So how do you ensure that employees have everything they need?
We know that the most common place employees work and engage today is in enterprise messaging platforms, like Slack and Microsoft Teams. We also know that other employees prefer enterprise portals that they've been navigating for ages. Others like the dependency of email.
Proper employee adoption requires a multifaceted approach. Here are the three pillars to your success:
Each company will evolve its own hybrid work best practices, but industry leaders will address each 4 of these concerns in their foundations in order to better serve their employees.

Moveworks uses Personal Data in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data for that reason only. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Site or Service, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
Moveworks and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Service, to better understand our users and to improve the Service. Moveworks and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
If Moveworks intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
Moveworks is not in the business of selling your information. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.  
We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
If you are using the Service in connection with your role as an employee or contractor of a company or other legal entity, we may share your information with such entity.
Moveworks, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function and we are liable to you for any onward transfers of Personal Data made by those other companies to their subcontractors and third-party agents.
Moveworks may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Moveworks, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
